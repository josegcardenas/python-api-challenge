# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

"What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

### Analysis

## Part I - WeatherPy

In this project, we begin by creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we will be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, we add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.

The second requirement was to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, we separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
